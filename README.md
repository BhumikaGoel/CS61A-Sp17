# CS61A-Sp17
This repository contains code from homework, lab sessions and projects completed in CS61A - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Spring 2017, UC Berkeley. An introduction to programming and computer science focused on abstraction techniques as means to manage program complexity. Techniques include procedural abstraction; control abstraction using recursion, higher-order functions, generators, and streams; data abstraction using interfaces, objects, classes, and generic operators; and language abstraction using interpreters and macros. The course exposes students to programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and declarative approaches. It includes an introduction to asymptotic analysis of algorithms. There are several significant programming projects.

Any duplication, reproduction or copying any part of the code and/or the entire code (including UC Berkeley students taking the course) without my permission is strictly against UC Berkeley code of conduct (for UC Berkeley students), and can and will count as plagiarism (for everyone). I hold no responsibility should a student (or any other individual) be caught plagiarizing and/or using my code as reference, as the code is made public solely for my professional growth.
